I finally got through to th end of my Javascript Project and it was truly a journey. I remember how the concept of APIs was one that I initially avoided because I thought it was so complex and hard to grasp. Never did I think that not only would I have understood the concept clearly but I could also create my own API!


What helped the most about this project was the fact that I was able to review and solidify all that I've learned so far throughout the entire course. So when it came time to join all that information and use it to create a website that others could gather data from, it became increasingly fascinating when I finally was able to include javascript, particularly JSON functionalities within my code! Of course, I had days of head aches and walks through the park, but being able to finally understand the magic behind all the Javascript and OO concepts have really been worth it.


Now, with this project, I was able to build a website that allows my users to play, add, display or remove visual and audio productions that would be available through the media production company. Ultimately, my aim is to develop this exact site into a commercial entity and I am two steps closer, thanks to Javascript and this project!
