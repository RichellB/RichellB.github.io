So I am finally at my final project with Flatiron and I must say, it was both exciting and overwhelming. My introduction to React felt like an alien invasion of my brain and it took quite some time to grasp all the new concepts and fundamentals of this beast of a language. 

My project is designed to have users of the OVOS website to access, view, listen to and purchase licensed beats or audio products. It gives the users the ability to modifiy and manage their purchases while still being able to access the site's audio products. My Rails API serves as my backend server that handles my database and any fetch requests while my React/Redux frontend controls the rendering of site information, the interaction of users with the site and the overall site design.  It was a challenge to incorporate all these features while requiring a login for users using React with my Rails API, however, I later learned with React, nothing is impossible!

Moreover, completely comprehending the concepts of state, props and the different components was a journey of it's own but the reward of overcoming this challenge has been the final boost that I needed to confidently take on the world of coding in any environment!
