I was very excited for my second project, the Sinatra Porject as I knew this would be something that I would be able to make daily use of! For my Sinatra Project, I decided to build a basic website that would allow artists of the record label to add, access and modify their user library. This is a major stepping stone in my ultimate goal of being able to develop a full stack web application for my fiance's Record Label and the business.

My Sinatra app uses the integration of multiple models, controllers and embedded ruby files to allow each artist to create their own user library with a database of all their songs and albums. The artist needs to either sign up or log in to be able to access the database and/or make changes to their records within the database.

The most challenging part of this application, however, was getting my views to be rendered correctly through my controller files. Everything worked amazingly, until suddenly, my erb files were not able to be found naywhere. Turns out, I just had to delete the main page erb file, re-create it and change the file name. Needless to say, this was a very interesting project!
