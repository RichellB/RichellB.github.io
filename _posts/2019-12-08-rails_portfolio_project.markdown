This project was definitely the hardest one that I've done so far! Primarily, not because of the requirements or the design  of the project, but just the wealth of knowledge that had to be implemented behind it's development. 

Trying to keep up with the powerful tools available through Rails, while not losing knowledge of the basic hard-coded processes from before was my biggest challenge. I started the project with a clear path of what I wanted it to achieve, however, less than midway through, I found myself lost in the fundamentals and differences between previous CRUD actions and CRUD with Rails. I had to stop the project for a few days, revisit my materials all over again and practically start over, almost from scratch. 

Needless to say, once I was able to clearly distinguish between the two, my entire development process became more comprehensive, smooth and fascinating, and yet, still challenging. Ultimately, I was able to put everything together to go one step (major step) further in developing a customized user library that will one day help with my family's record label company! Completing this project also helped me to appreciate the power of Rails even more and even more so, the power of having the knowledge on how it all works!
